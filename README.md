## How to Run the Program

In main.cpp, run the main function.
0 command line args - Interactive mode - run the driver program
1 command line arg - build for Github and testing
3 command line args - input file, path to directory of source image library, output file with path


Interactive mode contains tunable resolution parameter, which just means the size
of each source image in the mosaic. For example, if the resolution is 20, then each
image comprising the Mosaic will be 20 by 20 pixels.
